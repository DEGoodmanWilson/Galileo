See sample.py for an example of how to use this module. It's really very
simple, but you must remember that there a number of variables that
must be set, as they do not have default values.

Much of this program is cribbed from the C++ ga2 library, also by D.E.
Goodman-Wilson. That in turn was based on Goldberg's work from his book /Genetic
Algorithms/

Note, you don't have to install this to use it. You can simply copy
galileo.py to your project directory, or, if you do want to install it,
copy galileo.py to python's site-packages directory. Under unix, this
is usually /usr/lib/python/site-packages. Under windows...I don't know.
OS X (with which this was developed) uses the unix path listed above.

THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!
It has bugs. I just haven't found them yet. And I haven't implemented
ranked selection yet either, which a lot of people will want. Email reports
of bugs are greatly appreciated!
